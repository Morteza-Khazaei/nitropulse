# SAR Backscatter Inversion Package

A Python package for estimating soil and vegetation parameters from Sentinel-1 radar data using ground-based measurements from RISMA (Real-time In-Situ Soil Monitoring for Agriculture) networks.

## Overview

The inversion workflow consists of the following main steps:

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation
- **RISMA Ground Measurements**:
  - Downloads and prepares soil moisture and temperature data from RISMA stations.
  - Stores all necessary CSV files in the `./assets/inputs/...` directory.
- **Sentinel-1 Backscatter Data**:
  - Retrieves Sentinel-1 backscatter data from Google Earth Engine (GEE).
  - Applies spatial buffering around each RISMA station to a reliable time series of backscatter data for each station.

### 2. Growing Degree Days (GDD) and Phenology Modeling
- **GDD Calculation**:
  - Calculates accumulated Growing Degree Days (GDD) from RISMA temperature data.
- **BBCH Scale**:
  - Uses GDD to compute the BBCH scale, generating a time series of crop growth stages.
  - Estimates crop height per day of year (DOY), a critical parameter for vegetation radiative transfer modeling (RTM).

### 3. Inversion Process
- **Backscatter Separation**:
  - Separates total backscatter from Sentinel-1 images into soil and vegetation components.
- **Radiative Transfer Models**:
  - Uses vegetation RTM and crop height data to accurately estimate soil and vegetation parameters.

### 4. Machine Learning and Deployment
- **Ensemble Model Training**:
  - Trains and tests ensemble models to estimate:
    - Bare soil backscatter
    - Soil roughness
    - Soil moisture
- **Google Earth Engine Deployment**:
  - Deploys trained models to the GEE platform for large-scale soil moisture estimation using Sentinel-1 backscatter images.

## Available RISMA Stations

The package includes 13 RISMA stations in Manitoba, Canada:

You can specify individual stations or use the default (all stations):

```bash
# Process specific stations
python -m inversion --stations MB1 MB5 MB10

# Process all stations (default)
python -m inversion --auto-download
```

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Downloads RISMA ground-truth data (soil moisture, temperature)
- Applies spatial buffering around station locations and retrieves Sentinel-1 backscatter data from Google Earth Engine

### 2. Phenology Modeling
- Runs BBCH phenology model to determine crop growth stages
- Outputs phenology data to `outputs/pheno_df.csv`

### 3. Inversion Process
- Applies radiative transfer models (PRISM1, Diff)
- Uses AIEM for surface scattering modeling
- Estimates soil and vegetation parameters
- Outputs inversion results to `outputs/inv_df.csv`

### 4. Machine Learning
- Trains Random Forest ensemble models
- Uses specified features for parameter estimation
- Uploads trained models to Google Earth Engine

## Output Files

The package generates several output files in the `outputs/` directory:

- `pheno_df.csv`: Phenology model results with crop growth stages
- `inv_df.csv`: Inversion results with estimated parameters
- Various intermediate data files and model artifacts

## Configuration

### Custom Models

You can specify different radiative transfer models:

```bash
python -m inversion --models '{"RT_s": "PRISM2", "RT_v": "WCM"}'
```

### Feature Selection

Customize the features used for machine learning:

```bash
python -m inversion --features SSM VWC roughness lai
```

## Google Earth Engine Setup

1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Enable the Earth Engine API
3. Authenticate using `earthengine authenticate`
4. Provide your project ID when running the CLI

```bash
python -m inversion --gee-project-id your-gcp-project-id
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Error**: Ensure you've authenticated with Google Earth Engine:
```bash
earthengine authenticate
```

**Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider:
- Processing fewer stations at once
- Reducing the date range
- Increasing buffer distance cautiously

**Missing Data**: Check that:
- Station IDs are correct
- Date ranges overlap with available data
- GEE project has necessary permissions

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can inspect intermediate outputs in the workspace directory structure:

```
workspace/
├── inputs/
│   ├── RISMA_CSV_SSM_SST_AirT_2015_2023_new/
│   └── S1_data/
├── outputs/
│   ├── pheno_df.csv
│   └── inv_df.csv
└── models/
